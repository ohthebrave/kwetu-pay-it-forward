        <h3>About the organization</h3>
        <p>
          The inception of Kwetu Pay It Forward Foundation is deeply rooted in
          the philosophy of GIVING BACK. We use a simple leadership model of
          working in tandem with communities and schools within, in finding
          solutions to inequities that surround the disparities in the Kenyan
          education system. World Bank estimates Kenyan literacy rate to be 82%,
          where by 85% of the 25 million children enroll in Primary school, out
          of which 36% graduate high school and only 2% graduate college. Kenyan
          Primary Schools have the highest learner to computer ratio of 250
          students against 1 computer (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2012).
          Our goal is to establish fully equipped top premier centers for
          academia in the marginalized & low resource communities. This will
          give every child an equal opportunity to access quality education,
          create a hybrid educational system (both online & in-class) and
          connect students to the world by bridging the computer literacy gap.

        <h3>Financial Integrity </h3>
        <p>
          We are a CASHLESS organization. The digital world
          has created a global village by creating transactional platforms where
          money exchange is via credit/debit cards, checks and MPSA. This will
          ensure that money donated will fall in the right accounts hence
          accurate, and integral accountability through audit will be FULLY
          accessible on our website.
